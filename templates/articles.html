                    <h4>Curse of Dimensionality in Uniform p-ball Sampling Space</h4>
                    Curse of dimensionality reveals the fact that all sample points are going to become sparse and tend to the edge of the sampling space in high dimensions, which is a common problem in machine learning. This article is going to verify curse of dimensionality under a sampling space of a unit p-ball.
