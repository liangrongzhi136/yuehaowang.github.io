Installation
============


Prerequisites
-------------

1, Make sure you're using *python3*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Duckling* is built on *python3* and you may come across some weird problems if you import *duckling* to a *python2* project. The instructions below are based on the assumption that you are using *python3*, namely `python` and `pip` command serve *python3* instead of *python2*. If the default *python* in your system is *python2*, replace `python` and `pip` command in the following instructions with `python3` and `pip3` command respectively.


2, Make sure you're working on a 64-bit system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Duckling* engine is tested successfully merely on 64-bit systems which are wildly applied to modern computers. Also note, 64-bit *python3* instead of 32-bit *python3* is required when developing games with *duckling* engine.



Installation
------------

1, Clone *duckling*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone *duckling* to your local file system by using *git*: ::

	$ git clone https://github.com/yuehaowang/duckling.git

2, Install *duckling*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On *Windows*
""""""""""""

	Windows users have to install *PyOpenGL* by yourself before configuring *duckling* since *duckling* is based on it and official *PyOpenGL* package doesn't work satisfyingly on modern Windows. Few steps below will show you how to install an unofficial but suitable *PyOpenGL* package on your Windows. 

	First, download a *PyOpenGL* package which is compatible with your python environment `here <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl>`_. Then, install the downloaded *.wheel* file using ``pip install /path/to/your_downloaded_file.wheel``.

	After the setup of *PyOpenGL*, open *Command Prompt* (or *Powershell* ) in 'duckling/' directory and install *duckling* using ``python setup.py install``.

On *Linux/MacOS*
""""""""""""""""

	It's quite easy for Linux/MacOS users to install *duckling* game engine with the help of 'setup.py' after cloning *duckling* repo: ::

		$ cd ./duckling
		$ python setup.py install


	.. note::
	   If your installation is stopped by 'Permission denied', retry this step with prefixed command *sudo*.

3, Run demo and examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *duckling* repo cloned from Github contains some demo and examples which can be utilized to check whether the intallation is perfectly done. For instance, run a 'Hello World' demo: ::

	$ python demo/hello_world/main.py  # assuming your current working directory is 'duckling/'
